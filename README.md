# SilverStripe Catalog Manager

Catalog administration via a LeftAndMain like interface. Lets you edit and create pages outside of the SiteTree.

## Features


## Installation

Installation via composer

## How to use

### Pages

Add the following to a configuration yml file:

```yml
CatalogPage:
  extensions:
    - CatalogPageExtension
  parentClass: 'CatalogParentPage'
```

Where `CatalogPage` is the page type you wish to administer (e.g. BlogEntry) and `CatalogParentPage` is where the pages
should be stored in the SiteTree (e.g. BlogHolder). You may have multiple instances of the parent, the administration
will provide users with a drop down to choose which page should be the parent.

Then simply extend CatalogPageAdmin instead of ModelAdmin.

### DataObjects

You can also manage DataObjects through the `CatalogDataObjectExtension` (documentation coming soon)

### Translations

If you are using the translatable module, you can use the TranslatableCatalogExtension to provide functionality for
choosing languages.

```yml
CatalogPageAdmin:
  extensions:
    - TranslatableCatalogExtension
```
